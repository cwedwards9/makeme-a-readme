# Make Me a README
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-The%20MIT%20License-success.svg)](https://shields.io/)


## Description
This is a command line application that generates a professional README from a user's input. When a user runs the index file, they are prompted with relevant questions regarding their project. The answers are taken and inserted into a nice markdown format for a good-looking README.

In some cases, a developer wouldn't mind spending an hour adjusting an element's margin on a page, but draws the line when it comes to spending 20 minutes of needed time writing a README. A detailed and organized README is just as important as the project it is describing. Without it, users may not know anything about the project including: what its purpose is, what it does, and how to even start using it.

This application can really help developers who need motivation for writing their README and can be very helpful for those who are short on time and need to have something started for them.
